Some random scripts to do random things

* None of these scripts are particularily well done
* This is fun stuff done as a personal challenge
* More often than not, the usecase of these is too specific to be useful
* These scripts are very unlikely to be fit for use in production (except Schedule-Reboot)

Cheers
