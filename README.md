Some random scripts to do random things
When I was a student, I liked to automate or script my way through lessons I got at school as a personal challenge & for fun.

Keep in mind that:
* None of these scripts are particularily well done
* This is fun stuff done as a personal challenge
* More often than not, the usecase of these is too specific to be useful
* If you run these in production, bad things will happen to you

Cheers
